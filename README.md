# 📈 AdventureWorks Sales Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

This project demonstrates the design and development of an interactive sales performance dashboard built in Tableau Public, using historical data from the AdventureWorks dataset. It simulates a business case for internal sales tracking, enabling real-time performance monitoring and decision-making.

> 🗂️ Project Overview
The dashboard answers key sales questions using multiple Tableau features, simulating a real-world business environment where data is updated frequently.

> 🎯 Key Metrics Tracked
* Total Orders
* Total Sales ($)
* Average Order Value (AOV)
* Average Days to Ship

> 📊 Visualizations
* Monthly Sales Trends
* Year-Month time series
* Year-over-Year monthly comparison
* Sales Type Distribution
* Online vs Offline (based on SalespersonID presence)
* Sales Reason Analysis
* 100% stacked area chart showing reasons over time
* Salesperson Performance
* Individual contribution and cumulative % of total sales
* Geographical Sales Map
* Total sales mapped by region/territory

> 🛠️ Tools & Features Used
* Tableau Public for data visualization and dashboard creation
* Google Sheets as connected data source (Sales Order Data)
* Custom Calculated Fields and Table Calculations for KPIs and comparisons
* Parameters & Filters for interactive exploration
* Table Joins across:
* SalesOrderHeader
* SalesReason
* Territory

> 🧠 Insights & Considerations
* Sales surged by 36.2% from $40M in 2002 to $54.5M in 2003, alongside a 38% profit increase to $33M.
* Orders rose from 4,000 to 12,000 in 2003, but average order value(AOV) dropped sharply by 59.6% ($11K to $4K).
* USA led with $30M+ sales in 2003, followed by Canada ($9M) and Australia ($4M+), with offline sales driving growth.
* In 2002, offline sales channel dominated with $33M+, while online contributed 17.5%. By 2003, offline grew to $43M+, and online sales Channel improved its share, rising to 20.4% compared to 17.5% in the previous year.
* AWC Logo Cap dominated with $59M+ market cap over 4 years; promotions boosted 2003 sales by $2M+.
* August consistently saw peak sales, while January remained the lowest-performing month.

> 🚀 Opportunities for Enhancement
1. Optimizing Sales Channel
   * Top sales regions retained their rankings across both online and offline channels, with online sales contributing to a modest revenue increase of up to 3% from 2002 to 2003.
   * There is room to improve online sales through focused promotional campaigns and investment in digital marketing, which can help expand online channels and increase their revenue share.
2. Enhancing Seasonal Strategies
   * Maximizing peak sales in August and addressing the January slump with targeted discounts and new product launches could also result increased sales during these high and low moments.
4. Regional Expansion plans
   * It has been observed that after the introduction of the offline sales channel to regions such as Australia, Canada, and Europe in 2003, offline stores generated more revenue than the initially available online stores.
   * The offline business model is likely to work well across all regions. As a result, prioritizing the expansion of offline stores in high-demand regions like Australia, Canada, and Europe is highly relevant and strategic, hence adopting growth strategies from the USA is a way to go!
4. Improving Average Order Value
   * Following the aftermath of the AOV peaking low in 2003, strategies like bundle offers or loyalty programs can be implemented to boost the average order value and this would likely result in increase in sales amount.
